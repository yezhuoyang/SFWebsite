(** * Welcome *)

(** This is the entry point to a series of electronic textbooks on
    various aspects of _Software Foundations_, the mathematical
    underpinnings of reliable software.  Topics in the series include
    basic concepts of logic, computer-assisted theorem proving, the
    Rocq prover, functional programming, operational semantics, logics
    and techniques for reasoning about programs, static type systems,
    property-based random testing, and verification of practical C
    code.  The exposition is intended for a broad range of readers,
    from advanced undergraduates to PhD students and researchers.  No
    specific background in logic or programming languages is assumed,
    though a degree of mathematical maturity will be helpful.

    The principal novelty of the series is that it is one hundred
    percent formalized and machine-checked: each text is literally a
    script for Rocq.  The books are intended to be read alongside (or
    inside) an interactive session with Rocq.  All the details in the
    text are fully formalized in Rocq, and most of the exercises are
    designed to be worked using Rocq.

    The files in each book are organized into a sequence of core
    chapters, covering about one semester's worth of material and
    organized into a coherent linear narrative, plus a number of
    "offshoot" chapters covering additional topics.  All the core
    chapters are suitable for both upper-level undergraduate and
    graduate students.

    This book, _Logical Foundations_, lays groundwork for the others,
    introducing the reader to the basic ideas of functional
    programming, constructive logic, and the Rocq prover. *)

(** * Overview *)

(** Building reliable software is hard -- really hard.  The scale and
    complexity of modern systems, the number of people involved, and
    the range of demands placed on them make it challenging to build
    software that is even more-or-less correct, much less 100%%
    correct.  At the same time, the increasing degree to which
    information processing is woven into every aspect of society
    greatly amplifies the cost of bugs and insecurities.

    Computer scientists and software engineers have responded to these
    challenges by developing a host of techniques for improving
    software reliability, ranging from recommendations about managing
    software projects teams (e.g., extreme programming) to design
    philosophies for libraries (e.g., model-view-controller,
    publish-subscribe, etc.) and programming languages (e.g.,
    object-oriented programming, functional programming, ...)
    to mathematical techniques for
    specifying and reasoning about properties of software and tools
    for helping validate these properties.  The _Software Foundations_
    series is focused on this last set of tools.

    This volume weaves together three conceptual threads:

    (A) basic tools from _logic_ for making and justifying precise
        claims about programs;

    (B) the use of _proof assistants_ (or _provers_) to construct
        rigorous logical arguments;

    (C) _functional programming_, both as a method of programming that
        simplifies reasoning about programs and as a bridge between
        programming and logic. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Logic *)

(** Logic is the field of study whose subject matter is _proofs_ --
    unassailable arguments for the truth of particular propositions.
    Volumes have been written about the central role of logic in
    computer science.  Manna and Waldinger called it "the calculus of
    computer science," while Halpern et al.'s paper _On the Unusual
    Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science_ catalogs scores of
    ways in which logic offers critical tools and insights.  Indeed,
    they observe that, "As a matter of fact, logic has turned out to
    be significantly more effective in computer science than it has
    been in mathematics.  This is quite remarkable, especially since
    much of the impetus for the development of logic during the past
    one hundred years came from mathematics."

    In particular, the fundamental tools of _inductive proof_ are
    ubiquitous in all of computer science.  You have surely seen them
    before, perhaps in a course on discrete math or analysis of
    algorithms, but in this course we will examine them more deeply
    than you have probably done so far. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Proof Assistants *)

(** The flow of ideas between logic and computer science has not been
    unidirectional: CS has also made important contributions to logic.
    One of these has been the development of software tools for
    helping construct proofs of logical propositions.  These tools
    fall into two broad categories:

       - _Automated theorem provers_ provide "push-button" operation:
         you give them a proposition and they return either _true_ or
         _false_ (or, sometimes, _don't know: ran out of time_).
         Although their reasoning capabilities are still limited,
         they have matured tremendously in recent decades and
         are used now in a multitude of settings.  Examples of such
         tools include SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and model checkers.

       - _Proof assistants_ are hybrid tools that automate the more
         routine aspects of building proofs while depending on human
         guidance for more difficult aspects.  Widely used proof
         assistants include Isabelle, Agda, Twelf, ACL2, PVS, F*,
         HOL4, Lean, and Rocq, among many others.

    This course is based around Rocq, a proof assistant that has been
    under development since 1983 and has attracted a large community
    of users in both research and industry.  Rocq provides a rich
    environment for interactive development of machine-checked formal
    reasoning.  The kernel of the Rocq system is a simple
    proof-checker, which guarantees that only correct deduction steps
    are ever performed.  On top of this kernel, the Rocq environment
    provides high-level facilities for proof development, including a
    large library of common definitions and lemmas, powerful tactics
    for constructing complex proofs semi-automatically, and a
    special-purpose programming language for defining new
    proof-automation tactics for specific situations.

    Rocq has been a critical enabler for a huge variety of work across
    computer science and mathematics:

    - As a _platform for modeling programming languages_, it has
      become a standard tool for researchers who need to describe and
      reason about complex language definitions.  It has been used,
      for example, to check the security of the JavaCard platform,
      obtaining the highest level of common criteria certification,
      and for formal specifications of the x86 and LLVM instruction
      sets and programming languages such as C.

    - As an _environment for developing formally certified software
      and hardware_, Rocq has been used, for example, to build
      CompCert, a fully-verified optimizing compiler for C, and
      CertiKOS, a fully verified hypervisor, for proving the
      correctness of subtle algorithms involving floating point
      numbers, and as the basis for CertiCrypt, FCF, and SSProve,
      which are frameworks for proving cryptographic algorithms secure.
      It is also being used to build verified implementations of the
      open-source RISC-V processor architecture.

    - As a _realistic environment for functional programming with
      dependent types_, it has inspired numerous innovations.  For
      example, Hoare Type Theory embeds reasoning about
      "pre-conditions" and "post-conditions" (an extension of the
      _Hoare Logic_ we will see later in this course) in Rocq.

    - As a _proof assistant for higher-order logic_, it has been used
      to validate a number of important results in mathematics.  For
      example, its ability to include complex computations inside
      proofs made it possible to develop the first formally verified
      proof of the 4-color theorem.  This proof had previously been
      controversial among mathematicians because it required checking
      a large number of configurations using a program. In the Rocq
      formalization, everything is checked, including the correctness
      of the computational part.  More recently, an even more massive
      effort led to a Rocq formalization of the Feit-Thompson Theorem,
      the first major step in the classification of finite simple
      groups.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Functional Programming *)

(** The term _functional programming_ refers both to a collection of
    programming idioms that can be used in almost any programming
    language and to a family of programming languages designed to
    emphasize these idioms, including Haskell, OCaml, Standard ML,
    F##, Scala, Scheme, Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, Erlang, F*,
    and Rocq.

    Functional programming has been developed over many decades --
    indeed, its roots go back to Church's lambda-calculus, which was
    invented in the 1930s, well _before_ the first electronic
    computers!  But since the early '90s it has enjoyed a surge of
    interest among industrial engineers and language designers,
    playing a key role in high-value systems at companies like Jane
    Street Capital, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Ericsson.

    The most basic tenet of functional programming is that, as much as
    possible, computation should be _pure_, in the sense that the only
    effect of execution should be to produce a result: it should be
    free from _side effects_ such as I/O, assignments to mutable
    variables, redirecting pointers, etc.  For example, whereas an
    _imperative_ sorting function might take a list of numbers and
    rearrange its pointers to put the list in order, a pure sorting
    function would take the original list and return a _new_ list
    containing the same numbers in sorted order.

    A significant benefit of this style of programming is that it
    makes programs easier to understand and reason about.  If every
    operation on a data structure yields a new data structure, leaving
    the old one intact, then there is no need to worry about how that
    structure is being shared and whether a change by one part of the
    program might break an invariant relied on by another part of the
    program.  These considerations are particularly critical in
    concurrent systems, where every piece of mutable state that is
    shared between threads is a potential source of pernicious bugs.
    Indeed, a large part of the recent interest in functional
    programming in industry is due to its simpler behavior in the
    presence of concurrency.

    Another reason for the current excitement about functional
    programming is related to the first: functional programs are often
    much easier to parallelize and physically distribute than their
    imperative counterparts.  If running a computation has no effect
    other than producing a result, then it does not matter _where_ it
    is run.  Similarly, if a data structure is never modified
    destructively, then it can be copied freely, across cores or
    across the network.  Indeed, the "Map-Reduce" idiom, which lies at
    the heart of massively distributed query processors like Hadoop
    and is used by Google to index the entire web is a classic example
    of functional programming.

    For purposes of this course, functional programming has yet
    another significant attraction: it serves as a bridge between
    logic and computer science.  Indeed, Rocq itself can be viewed as a
    combination of a small but extremely expressive functional
    programming language plus a set of tools for stating and proving
    logical assertions.  Moreover, when we come to look more closely,
    we find that these two sides of Rocq are actually aspects of the
    very same underlying machinery -- i.e., _proofs are programs_.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Rocq vs. Coq *)

(** Until 2025, the Rocq prover was known as Coq. According to the
    official webpage, "The name 'Coq' referenced the Calculus of
    Constructions (CoC), the foundational system it is based on, as
    well as one of its creators, Thierry Coquand. Additionally, it
    paid homage to the French national symbol, the rooster.  The new
    name, 'the Rocq Prover', honors Inria Rocquencourt, the original
    site where the prover was developed. It also alludes to the
    mythological bird Roc (or Rokh), symbolizing strength and not so
    disconnected to a rooster. Furthermore, the name conveys a sense
    of solidity, and its unintended connection to music adds a
    pleasant resonance."

    The current release of Software Foundations is still in a
    transitional state, and you will see references to both Coq and
    Rocq. *)

(** ** Further Reading *)

(** This text is intended to be self contained, but readers looking
    for a deeper treatment of particular topics will find some
    suggestions for further reading in the [Postscript] chapter.
    Bibliographic information for all cited works can be found in the
    file [Bib].*)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Practicalities *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** System Requirements *)

(** Rocq runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  The files in this book
    have been tested with Rocq 9.0.0. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Recommended Installation Method: VSCode + Docker *)

(** The Visual Studio Code IDE can cooperate with the Docker
    virtualization platform to compile Rocq scripts without the need
    for any separate Rocq installation.  This method is recommended for
    most Software Foundations readers.

    - Install Docker from {https://www.docker.com/get-started/} or
      make sure your existing installation is up to date.

    - Make sure Docker is running.

    - Install VSCode from {https://code.visualstudio.com} and start it
      running.

    - Install VSCode's Dev Containers Extension from
      {https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers}

      (Note that this extension only works with the official version
      of VSCode, not with some VSCode forks like VsCodium.)

    - Set up a directory for this SF volume by downloading the
      provided [.tgz] file.  Besides the [.v] file for each chapter,
      this directory will contain a [.devcontainer] subdirectory with
      instructions for VSCode about where to find an appropriate
      Docker image and a [_CoqProject] file, whose presence triggers
      the VSCoq extension.

    - In VSCode, use [File > Open Folder] to open the new directory.
      VSCode should ask you whether you want to run the project in the
      associated Docker container.  (If it does not ask you, you can
      open the command palette by pressing F1 and run the command “Dev
      Containers: Reopen in Container”.)

      This step may take some time.

    - Check that VSCoq is working by double-clicking the file
      [Basics.v] from the list on the left (you should see a blinking
      cursor in the window that opens; if not you can click in that
      window to select it), and pressing [alt+downarrow] (on MacOS,
      [control+option+downarrow]) a few times.  You should see the
      cursor move through the file and the region above the cursor get
      highlighted.

      - If VSCoq does not work and you receive an error indicating that
        [vscoqtop] was not found, open a new terminal in the container
        (you can do this by opening the command palette and running the
        command “Terminal: Create New Terminal”) and run the command
        [which vscoqtop]. This should print the path to the VSCoq
        installation inside the container. Copy this path
        and paste it into the “VSCoq: Path” textbox in the
        VSCoq extension settings (accessible via the gear icon on
        the VSCoq extension page in VSCode), then reload your window.

    - To see what other key bindings are available, press F1 and then
      type [Coq:], or visit the VSCoq web pages:
      {https://github.com/rocq-prover/vsrocq}.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Alternative Installation Methods *)

(** If you prefer, there are several other ways to use Rocq. You will need:

    - A current installation of Rocq, available from the Rocq home
      page ({https://rocq-prover.org/install}).  The "Rocq Platform"
      offers the easiest installation experience for most people,
      especially on Windows.

    - An IDE for interacting with Rocq.  There are several choices:

        - _VsCoq_ is an extension for Visual Studio Code that offers a
          simple interface via a familiar IDE.  This option is the
          recommended default.

          VsCoq can be used as an ordinary IDE or it can be combined
          with Docker (see below) for a lightweight installation
          experience.

        - _Proof General_ is an Emacs-based IDE.  It tends to be
          preferred by users who are already comfortable with Emacs.
          It requires a separate installation (google "Proof General",
          but generally all you need to do is [M-x package-list-packages],
          then select the [proof-general] package from the list and
          hit the [i] key for install, then hit the [x] key for execute).

          There are only a few commands you need to know to use ProofGeneral
          effectively. They are:

          - [C-c C-n]: send the next command to Rocq.
          - [C-c C-u]: undo (retract) the most recently executed command.
          - [C-c C-RET]: submit everything up to the current cursor location to
            Rocq for processing.
          - [C-c C-.]: move the cursor to the end of the last command which has
            been processed by Rocq.
          - [C-c .]: toggle "electric terminator mode". When this mode is
            turned on, simply typing a period will send the current command to
            Rocq (normally you have to type a period and then type [C-c C-n]).

          Adventurous users of Rocq within Emacs may want to check out
          extensions such as [company-coq] and [control-lock].

        - _RocqIDE_ is a simpler stand-alone IDE.  It is distributed with
          the Rocq Platform, so it should be available once you have Rocq
          installed.  It can also be compiled from scratch, but on some
          platforms this may involve installing additional packages for GUI
          libraries and such.

          Users who like RocqIDE should consider running it with the
          "asynchronous" and "error resilience" modes disabled:

          coqide -async-proofs off \
                 -async-proofs-command-error-resilience off Foo.v &
*)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Exercises *)

(** Each chapter includes numerous exercises.  Each is marked with a
    "star rating," which can be interpreted as follows:

       - One star: easy exercises that underscore points in the text
         and that, for most readers, should take only a minute or two.
         Get in the habit of working these as you reach them.

       - Two stars: straightforward exercises (five or ten minutes).

       - Three stars: exercises requiring a bit of thought (ten
         minutes to half an hour).

       - Four and five stars: more difficult exercises (half an hour
         and up).

    Those using SF in a classroom setting should note that the autograder
    assigns extra points to harder exercises:

      1 star  = 1 point
      2 stars = 2 points
      3 stars = 3 points
      4 stars = 6 points
      5 stars = 10 points

    Some exercises are marked "advanced," and some are marked
    "optional."  Doing just the non-optional, non-advanced exercises
    should provide good coverage of the core material.  Optional
    exercises provide a bit of extra practice with key concepts and
    introduce secondary themes that may be of interest to some
    readers.  Advanced exercises are for readers who want an extra
    challenge and a deeper cut at the material.

    _Please do not post solutions to the exercises in a public place_.
    Software Foundations is widely used both for self-study and for
    university courses.  Having solutions easily available makes it
    much less useful for courses, which typically have graded homework
    assignments.  We especially request that readers not post
    solutions to the exercises anyplace where they can be found by
    search engines. *)
