(** Programmers have to be very careful about how information flows in
    the software they develop to prevent leaking secret data. For
    instance, in course management systems students shouldn't be able
    to obtain information about other student's grades. In crypto
    protocols the keys should be kept secret and not sent over the
    network in the clear. *)

(** Information-flow control tries to prevent leaking secret
    information.  But how does one formalize that a program doesn't
    leak any information about the secret inputs to public outputs? *)

(** We first investigate this question in the very simple setting of Rocq
    functions taking two arguments, one we call the public input and the other
    one we call the secret input. Our functions return a pair where the first
    element is the public output and the second one the secret output. *)

(** Say we have the following function working on natural numbers: *)

Definition secure_f (pi si : nat) : nat*nat := (pi+1, pi+si*2).

(** This function seems intuitively secure, since the first output [pi+1], which
    we assume to be public, only depends on the public input [pi], but not on
    the secret input [si]. The second output [pi+si*2] depends on both the
    public input and the secret input, but that's okay, since we assume this
    second output to be secret. *)

(** Still, how can we mathematically define that this function is
    secure? Let's try it on a couple of inputs: *)

Example example1_secure_f : secure_f 0 0 = (1,0).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example example2_secure_f : secure_f 0 1 = (1,2).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example example3_secure_f : secure_f 1 2 = (2,5).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** In the last two cases the value of the public output is equal to the value
    of secret input. But that's just a coincidence, and has nothing to do with
    the public output leaking the secret input, which wasn't used at all in
    computing the public output. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Naive attempt at defining secrecy *)

(** So a naive security definition, which we'll only use as a strawman, is one
    that simply requires that public outputs are different from secret inputs: *)

Definition broken_sec_def (f : nat -> nat -> nat*nat) :=
  forall pi si, fst (f pi si) <> si.

(** As discussed above, this definition would reject our secure
    function above as insecure: *)

Lemma broken_sec_def_rejects_secure_f : ~broken_sec_def secure_f.
Proof. intros Hc. apply (Hc 0 1). reflexivity. Qed.

(** Even worse, this broken definition of security would allow insecure
    functions, such as the following one whose public output is [si+1]: *)

Definition insecure_f (pi si : nat) : nat*nat := (si+1, pi+si*2).

(** This function's public output is never equal to its secret input, yet an
    attacker can easily compute one from the other by just subtracting [1]. So
    the secret is entirely leaked, yet our broken definition accepts this: *)

Lemma broken_sec_def_accepts_insecure_f : broken_sec_def insecure_f.
Proof.
  unfold broken_sec_def. intros pi si. induction si as [| si' IH].
  - simpl. intros contra. discriminate contra.
  - simpl in *. intro Hc. injection Hc as Hc. apply IH. apply Hc.
Qed.

(** This attempt at defining secure information flow by looking at how
    inputs and outputs are related for a single execution of the
    program was a complete failure. In fact, it is well known in the
    formal security research community that secure information flow
    _cannot_ be defined by looking at just one single program execution. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Noninterference for pure functions *)

(** The simplest correct way to define secure information flow is a
    property called _noninterference_ [Sabelfeld and Myers 2003] (in Bib.v),
    which in its most standard form looks at _two_ program executions:
    for two different secret inputs the public outputs should not change: *)

Definition noninterferent {PI SI PO SO : Type} (f:PI->SI->PO*SO) :=
  forall (pi:PI) (si1 si2:SI), fst (f pi si1) = fst (f pi si2).

(** This definition prevents secret inputs from interfering with public
    outputs in any way. At the same time it allows secret inputs to
    influence secret outputs and also public inputs to influence both
    public and secret outputs:

                                ┌───╮

*)

(** The definition above defines noninterference for arbitrary types
    of inputs and outputs, so we can instantiate them to [nat] when
    looking at our example functions above: *)

Qed.

(** The [secure_f] function above is quite obviously noninterferent,
    because the expression [pi+1] computing the public output doesn't
    syntactically mention the secret input at all. Since
    noninterference is a semantic property though (not a syntactic
    one), functions where the expression computing the public input
    does syntactically mention the secret input can still be
    noninterferent. Here is a first example: *)

Definition less_obvious_f1 (pi si : nat) : nat*nat := (si * 0, pi+si).

(** This function is noninterferent; since the public output is
    constant [0], so it can't depend on [si], even if it syntactically
    mentions it: *)

(** Here is another example of a function that is noninterferent, even
    if this is not syntactically obvious: *)

Definition less_obvious_f2 (pi si : nat) : nat*nat :=
  (if Nat.eqb si 1 then si * pi else pi, pi+si).

(** For proving this we show that the public output of this function
    is in fact always equal to just its public input: *)

Lemma aux_f2 : forall si pi, (if Nat.eqb si 1 then si * pi else pi) = pi.
Proof.

Qed.

(** Branching on a secret can, however, be dangerous, since one can
    easily leak the secret this way, even if both the [then] and the
    [else] branches are public. For instance the following function
    leaks whether [si] is zero or not, so it is not noninterferent. *)

Definition less_obvious_f3 (pi si : nat) : nat*nat :=

(** In the definition of noninterference above we pass the same public

  forall (pi1 pi2:PI) (si1 si2:SI), fst (f pi1 si1) = fst (f pi2 si2).

(** This basically says that the public output of [f] can depend

    be constant, which is not the case for our [secure_f]. *)

(** * Noninterferent implies splittable *)

(** Noninterference is still a very strong property, though. In
    particular, [f] being noninterferent is equivalent to [f] being

    the secret at all. *)

(** * Secure Multi-Execution (SME) *)

(** The previous proof also captures the key idea behind Secure
    Multi-Execution (SME) [Devriese and Piessens 2010] (in Bib.v), an
    enforcement mechanism that can make _any_ function
    noninterferent. To achieve this SME runs the function twice, once
    passing a dummy secret as input to obtain the public output, and
    once using the real secret input to obtain the secret output. *)

Proof. intros PI SI PO SO some_si f pi si1 si2. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Moreover, if the function we pass to [sme] is already noninterferent,
    then its behavior will not change; so we say that [sme] is a _transparent_
    enforcement mechanism for noninterference: *)

Theorem transparent_sme : forall PI SI PO SO : Type,
  forall some_si : SI,
  forall f : PI -> SI -> PO*SO,

(** It is interesting to look at what [sme] does for _interferent_ functions,

(** The other downside of [sme] is that we have to run the function
    twice for our two security levels, public and secret. In general,
    we need to run the program as many times as we have security
    levels, which is often an exponential number, say if we take our
    security levels to be sets of principals. This is inefficient!

    Other information-flow control mechanisms overcome this downside,
    but have other downsides of their own, for instance:
        - by requiring nontrivial manual proofs for each individual
          program (e.g., Relational Hoare Logic), or
        - by using static overapproximations that reject some secure
          programs (security type systems), or
        - by using dynamic overapproximations that unnecessarily
          change program behavior, for instance forcefully terminating
          even some secure programs to prevent leaks, in which case
          they are not transparent (dynamic information-flow control;
          an extension of dynamic taint tracking to also handle
          implicit flows).

    Again, there is no free lunch! *)

(** Turns out we can only prove a weak version of transparency for
    noninterferent programs, and this has to do with nontermination
    (more later). *)

(** But first we need a few lemmas:  *)

Lemma pub_equiv_split_state : forall (pub:pub_vars) s,
  pub_equiv pub (split_state s pub true) s.
Proof.
  unfold pub_equiv, split_state.
  intros pub s x Hx. destruct (Bool.eqb_spec (pub x) true).
  - reflexivity.
  - contradiction.

Lemma pub_equiv_sym : forall (pub:pub_vars) s1 s2,

Lemma merge_state_pub_equiv : forall pub ss ps,

  intros x. destruct (pub x) eqn:Heq.
  - rewrite H.

    + assumption.
  - reflexivity.
Qed.

(** More specifically, we can only prove that an [sme_while] execution
    implies a [ceval] execution: *)

Theorem somewhat_transparent_while_sme : forall pub c,
  noninterferent_while pub c ->
  (forall s s', (sme_while pub) c s s' -> s =[ c ]=> s').
Proof.
  unfold noninterferent_while, sme_while.
  intros pub c Hni s s' [ps [ss [Hp [Hs Hm]]]]. subst s'.
    assert(H:pub_equiv pub s (split_state s pub true)).
    { apply pub_equiv_sym. apply pub_equiv_split_state. }
    specialize (Hni s (split_state s pub true) ss ps H Hs Hp).
    apply merge_state_pub_equiv in Hni. rewrite Hni. apply Hs.
Qed.

(** But we cannot prove the reverse implication, since a command
    terminating when starting in state [s], does not necessarily still
    terminate when starting in state [split_state s pub true], as
    would be needed for proving [sme_while]. *)

(** Yet it seems we can still do most of the things as in the setting
    without while loops, including SME (just not fully transparent).
    So is there anything special about loops and nontermination?

    Yes, there is! Let's look at our noninterference definition again:

Definition noninterferent_while pub c := forall s1 s2 s1' s2',
  pub_equiv pub s1 s2 ->
  s1 =[ c ]=> s1' ->
  s2 =[ c ]=> s2' ->
  pub_equiv pub s1' s2'.

    It says that for any two _terminating_ executions, if the initial states
    agree on their public variables, then so do the final states. This is
    traditionally called _termination-insensitive_ noninterference (TINI),
    since it doesn't consider nontermination to be observable to an attacker. *)

(** In particular, the following program is _secure_ wrt TINI: *)

Definition termination_leak : com :=
  <{ if Y = 0 then
       Y := 42
     else
       while true do skip end (* <- leak secret by looping *)
     end }>.

(** And we can prove it ... *)

Lemma Y_neq_X : (Y <> X).
Proof. intro contra. discriminate. Qed.

(** We use a lemma that is a homework exercise in Imp: *)
Check loop_never_stops : forall st st',
  ~(st =[ loop ]=> st').

Definition tini_secure_termination_leak :
  noninterferent_while xpub termination_leak.
Proof.
  unfold noninterferent_while, termination_leak, pub_equiv.

  subst. specialize (H X xpubX).
  invert H1.

    * apply loop_never_stops in H8. contradiction.

(** * Termination-Sensitive Noninterference *)

(** We can give a stronger definition of security that disallows such
    nontermination leaks. It is traditionally called
    _termination-sensitive noninterference_ (TSNI) and it is defined
    as follows: *)

Definition tsni_while_R (R:com->state->state->Prop) pub c :=

  R c s1 s1' ->
  pub_equiv pub s1 s2 ->

(** More generally, we can prove that TSNI is strictly stronger than TINI
    (noninterferent_while) *)

Lemma tsni_noninterferent : forall pub c,
  tsni_while_R ceval pub c ->
  noninterferent_while_R ceval pub c.
Proof.

(** The reverse direction of the implication only works for programs that
    always terminate (such as most of our simple examples above). *)

Lemma terminating_noninterferent_tsni: forall pub c,
  (forall s, exists s', s =[ c ]=> s') ->
  noninterferent_while_R ceval pub c ->
  tsni_while_R ceval pub c.
Proof.

Qed.

(** Unfortunately [sme_while] does not _enforce_ TSNI and this is hard
    to fix in our current setting, where programs only return a result
    in the end, a final state, so we had to merge the public and
    secret inputs into a single final state. Instead, SME is commonly
    defined in a setting with interactive IO, in which public outputs
    and secret outputs can be performed independently, during the
    execution [Devriese and Piessens 2010] (in Bib.v). In that setting, it
    does transparently enforce a termination-insensitive version of
    noninterference later research has called Indirect TSNI
    [Ngo et al 2018] (in Bib.v). *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Optional: Counterexample showing that SME doesn't enforce TSNI *)

(** We build a counterexample command that does not satisfy TSNI and
    for which the same publicly equivalent initial states [s1] and
    [s2] can be used to show that it still does not satisfy TSNI when
    run with [sme_while].

    In particular, we choose [s1] below so that the command terminates
    and so that zeroing out the secret variable Y has no effect on [s1].
    We choose [s2] so that the command loops, which implies that it
    will still loop on [s2] also when executed with [sme_while]. *)
